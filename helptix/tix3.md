# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET

Setting state with nested data. State is supposed to have nested data about the chat messages.

```
state = {
  messages: [
    {
      text: "This is a test message!",
      member: {
        color: "blue",
        username: "bluemoon"
      }
    }
  ],
  member: {
    username: randomName(),
    color: randomColor()
  }
}
```

## Unexpected Behavior

I just can't seem to figure out how to do it.
