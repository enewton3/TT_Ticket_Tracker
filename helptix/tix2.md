# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET

Getting header nav to sit to the right of the screen.

## Unexpected Behavior

Confusion over when to use flexbox row-wrap vs display: inline (or both)

## Expected Behavior

To have the nav sit to the right of screen inline with the logo.

## Attempted Resolution

I've spent too much time trying to figure this out..... need help! I'm sure it's something not too difficult.
Thanks!
